abstract = {We describe RCWA4D, an electromagnetic solver for layered structures with incommensurate periodicities. Our method is based on an extension of the rigorous coupled wave analysis. We illustrate our method on the example of twisted bilayer photonic crystal and show that various properties of such structures can be reliably simulated. The method can be generalized to multi-layer structures in general in which each layer is periodic or quasi-periodic.}

  abstract={We analyze scattering properties of twisted bilayer photonic crystal slabs through a high-dimensional plane wave expansion method. The method is applicable for arbitrary twist angles and does not suffer from the limitations of the commonly used supercell approximation. We show strongly tunable resonance properties of this system which can be accounted for semianalytically from a correspondence relation to a simpler structure. We also observe strongly tunable resonant chiral behavior in this system. Our work provides the theoretical foundation for predicting and understanding the rich optical physics of twisted multilayer photonic crystal systems.},

abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate tunable guided resonance in twisted bilayer photonic crystals. Both the numerically and the experimentally obtained transmission spectra feature resonances with frequencies strongly dependent on the twist angle, as well as resonances with frequencies that are largely independent of the twist angle. These resonant features can be well understood with a simple analytic theory based on band folding. Our work illustrates the rich tunable resonance physics in twisted bilayer systems. When two layers of photonic crystal slabs are twisted, guided resonance in the structure can be tuned by varying the twist angle.}}

abstract = {Recently, twisted bilayer photonic materials have been extensively used for creating and studying photonic tunability through interlayer couplings. While twisted bilayer photonic materials have been experimentally demonstrated in microwave regimes, a robust platform for experimentally measuring optical frequencies has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip optical twisted bilayer photonic crystal with twist angle–tunable dispersion and great simulation-experiment agreement. Our results reveal a highly tunable band structure of twisted bilayer photonic crystals due to moiré scattering. This work opens the door to realizing unconventional twisted bilayer properties and novel applications in optical frequency regimes. Optical bilayer photonic crystals are tuned via twist angle.}}

abstract = {Meta-learning aims to train a model on various tasks so that given sample data from a task, even if unforeseen, it can adapt fast and perform well. We apply techniques from compressed sensing to shed light on the effect of inner-loop regularization in meta-learning, with an algorithm that minimizes cross-task interference without compromising weight-sharing.In our algorithm, which is representative of numerous similar variations, the model is explicitly trained such that upon adding a pertinent sparse output layer, it can perform well on a new task with very few number of updates, where cross-task interference is minimized by the sparse recovery of output layer. We demonstrate that this approach produces good results on few-shot regression, classification and reinforcement learning, with several benefits in terms of training efficiency, stability and generalization.},

In this paper, we continue with our study of these jigsaw groups exploring questions of arithmeticity, pseudomodularity, and also related pseudo-euclidean and continued fraction algorithms arising from these groups. We also answer another question of Long and Reid by demonstrating a recursive formula for the tessellation of the hyperbolic plane arising from Weierstrass groups which generalizes the well-known Farey addition used to generate the Farey tessellation."
