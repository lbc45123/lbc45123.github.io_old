This project dives into the mathematical structures known as pseudomodular groups, which arise from "hyperbolic jigsaws".

### Research Focus
- **Hyperbolic Geometry:** Constructing infinite families of non-commensurable, non-uniform lattices.
- **Group Theory:** Answering open problems posed by Long and Reid regarding the existence of these groups.
- **Tessellations:** Exploring the beautiful recursive formulas for tessellating the hyperbolic plane.

This work bridges geometry, topology, and number theory.
