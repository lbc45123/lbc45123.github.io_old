This project explores the fascinating optical properties of twisted bilayer photonic crystal slabs. By stacking two photonic crystal slabs and rotating them relative to each other, we create a moiré pattern that significantly alters the flow of light.

### Key Highlights
- **Tunable Resonance:** We demonstrated how the twist angle can be used to tune the frequency of guided resonances.
- **Flat Bands:** Moiré physics leads to the emergence of extremely flat bands, which can enhance light-matter interaction.
- **Inverse Design:** Using machine learning and automatic differentiation to design these complex structures.
